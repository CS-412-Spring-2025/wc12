# Weekly Challenge 06 (Group): Divide and Conquer Multiplication
# CS/CE 412/471 Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Spring 2025
***

Each Weekly Challenge (WC) invites you to critically engage with the topics covered up to that week. They may take on a variety of formats and be available and attempted through diverse platforms as the semester progresses. WCs are to be attempted individually, unless specified otherwise.

# Purpose

In this WC, you will work in groups and:
- understand and modify a divide-and-conquer algorithm to multiply 2 n-digit numbers efficiently 
- demonstrate step-by-step working with examples and hand-drawn illustrations.
- derive recurrence relations from the given algorithm 
- solve recurrence relations using methods like substitution, recursion trees, and/or the Master Theorem,

# Background and Requirements

To attempt and submit the task, you will need:
- A strong understanding of recurrence relations and how to model recursive algorithms mathematically.
- Familiarity with recursion trees, including how to construct them and calculate costs at each level.
- Proficiency in solving recurrence relations using methods such as substitution, iteration, or the Master Theorem.
- Familiarity with designing pseudocode for recursive algorithms using the divide-and-conquer approach.
- Knowledge of time complexity analysis, including the ability to express and solve recurrence relations.
- Working knowledge of GitHub and LaTeX
